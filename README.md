# Mazecraft
A fun maze solving game with an easy to use custom maze editor.

I will include more detail here soon, but it's easy to get started.

Make sure you have the Pygame package installed, that should be all you need. Please inform me of any troubles you have via my email: zvisger@worldxstudio.com


open Mazecraft.py in Python and run it

In game controls:
WSAD or Up, Down, Left, Right to move
Hold shift to go fast! < - Important

Hopefully the editor is easy enough to figure out.

Keys with the same index/color as a door will open the corresponding door.
Portals begins and ends of the same index/color will teleport you between them upon standing on them
