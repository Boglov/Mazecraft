# Mazecraft
A fun maze solving game with an easy to use custom maze editor.

I will include more detail here soon, but it's easy to get started.

Make sure you have the Pygame package installed, that should be all you need. Please inform me of any troubles you have via my email: zvisger@worldxstudio.com


open Mazecraft.py in Python and run it
